# Arduino Sketches

These sketches are imported from long ago -- circa 2016 as per what record I can find in my notes. Shame on me for never checking them into source revision control!

## usage

- deps
  - [Arduino IDE v2.3.4](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
    * Alternatively, you may use PlatformIO via cmdline OR even Visual Code, but I have yet to set this up as of yet.
